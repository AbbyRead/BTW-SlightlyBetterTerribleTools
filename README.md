# Slightly Better Terrible Tools

An addon for Better Than Wolves: Community Edition 3.0.0 that gives the worst tools in the game a slight boost in utility.

> According to Sid Meier, a [good] game is a series of interesting choices. In an interesting choice, no single option is clearly better than the other options, the options are not equally attractive, and the player must be able to make an informed choice. (Rollings & Morris 2000, p. 38.)

When you first start playing this mod, the tools you use (bare hands included) are the only things you will have at your disposal to carve out your journey.  Beyond that though, they lose value completely.  I understand the desire to reward progression, but I don't think that abandoning the thought of using older tools entirely so early in the game experience makes for a more interesting game experience.  I believe they can still have use, add value, and reward creativity if the easiest tools to come by would be just a little better.
