# Slightly Better Terrible Tools

An addon for Better Than Wolves: Community Edition 3.0.0 that gives the worst tools in the game a slight boost in utility.

## Impetus
"A [good] game is a series of interesting choices." &ensp;– Sid Meier

With that in mind I've made small, thoughtful changes to some of the worst items.

### Why?
1. A large part of the early game is spent with these tools, and their extreme slowness makes that stage feel more punishing than challenging.
2. Past the early game, they’re ignored entirely, which removes them as meaningful choices and leaves them as nothing but a one-time hurdle.
3. Games should respect your time; if a tool makes you consider rubber-banding your mouse just to break a block, the balance has slipped from difficult into tedious.
4. Good design offers more than one viable approach, and giving weak tools extra utility encourages trade-offs instead of forcing a single “correct” option.

### Short story long...
This addon doesn’t try to turn Pointy Sticks or Sharp Stones into cheats. They’re still fragile, inefficient, and meant to be less-fun (but sane) options prior to renewable iron. They just won't be so bad you want to abandon them *literally* as soon as possible. Instead, they will serve as a somewhat viable option when you don’t have very much access to better tools... at any point, for any reason.

## Changes
- **Terrible Tools: Modest Boost to Overall Efficiency.**  Choice of +25% or +50%. Sharp stones and pointy sticks cut blocks a little faster, making them less punishing to use.  Bare hands (not just anything) will use the same amount of boost toward tree punching.  +50% is still slow, just not irritatingly so.
- **Pointy Stick Durability Adjustment:** It now has 4 uses, to save time and space compared to having a row full of sticks.  Having two more uses than absolutely necessary may also incentivize experimentation.
- **Situational Use and Efficiency Changes:** Pointy sticks loosen blocks, bare hands dig loose material, sharp stones shatter and cut things.
- **No More Wasted Tool Durability:** Items do not take damage upon harvesting or destroying a block if doing so with anything else would be just as fast.

## Installation
1. Install Better Than Wolves: Community Edition 3.0.0 + Legacy Fabric by following along with the instructions on the [wiki](https://wiki.btwce.com/view/Main_Page).
2. On the Releases page of this repo, download the .jar file corresponding to your preferred base-efficiency bonus, either `_plus25` or `_plus50` percent, and add **only that one** using the Prism Launcher Interface under this instance's `Mods` tab.  If you add both, things might get weird.  It's supposed to be a choice between a more purist 25% and a more pleasant 50% boost.  I prefer using the `_plus50`.
3. Launch Minecraft using the instance, and you should see this mod displaying to chat on world load.  Otherwise something was amiss in the installation process of it.  Go back and follow along again and/or ask for help on [Discord](https://discord.btwce.com/).

## Compatibility
- Built against **BTW:CE 3.0.0 Beta Snapshot 6**.
- It should work with other addons just fine if they don't dovetail too much with this addon in their features.  It's made using mixins instead of new item classes and overrides.
