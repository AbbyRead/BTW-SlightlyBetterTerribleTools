# Slightly Better Terrible Tools

An addon for Better Than Wolves: Community Edition 3.0.0 that gives the worst tools in the game a slight boost in utility.

With that in mind I've made small, thoughtful changes to some of the worst items.

### Why?
1) A notable portion of the early game is spent using them, and it sucks.  It doesn't feel good.  It shouldn't feel great, but it feels insulting how long it takes to harvest blocks.  Better Than Wolves has always been a bit off-putting, but I think the pendulum swung a little too far this time.
2) Beyond the early game, I avoided them because it takes so long and feels so bad to use them.  If you avoid using something completely, you put it out of your mind as an option.  It instead becomes just a punishment for the early game.
3) Games should feel good to play; they should reward or respect your time and attention.  If I'm considering putting a rubber-band around my mouse to hold-click just to harvest a single block, I think something went wrong with the game balance.  And not in a hard way; just in an irritating way.
4) There should never be only one sane way to do something.  On that note, giving these tools other uses churns through materials faster, which might make it harder to decide what tool would be better to use in a situation.

### Short story long...
This addon doesn’t try to turn pointy sticks or sharp stones into endgame tools. They’re still fragile, inefficient, and meant to be less-fun (but sane) options prior to renewable iron. They're just no longer *so bad* that you immediately write them off as a waste of time. Instead, they can serve as a somewhat viable option when you don’t have much access to better tools at any point, for any reason.

## Changes
- **Terrible Tools: Modest Boost to Overall Efficiency.**  Choice of +25% or +50%. Sharp stones and pointy sticks cut blocks a little faster, making them less punishing to use.  Bare hands (not just anything) will use the same amount of boost toward tree punching.  +50% is still slow, just not irritatingly so.
- **Pointy Stick Durability Adjustment:** It now has 4 uses, to save time and space compared to having a row full of sticks.  Having two more uses than absolutely necessary may also incentivize experimentation.
- **Situational Use and Efficiency Changes:** Pointy sticks loosen blocks, bare hands dig loose material, sharp stones shatter and cut things.
- **No More Wasted Tool Durability:** Items do not take damage upon harvesting or destroying a block if doing so with anything else would be just as fast.
